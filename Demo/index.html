        <h3>C++</h3>
        <p>
          C++ is an object-oriented programming language. It is an extension to C programming.
        </p>
       
        <h3>What is C++?</h3>
        <p>
          C++ is a general purpose, case-sensitive, free-form programming language that supports object-oriented, procedural and generic programming.

          C++ is a middle-level language, as it encapsulates both high and low level language features.
        </p>
       
        <h3>Components of  C++?</h3>
        <p>
          <ul>
         <li> Comments: The two slash(//) signs are used to add comments in a program.It does not have any effect on the behavior or outcome of the program. It is used to give a description of the program you’re writing.</li>
         <li> #include: #include is the pre-processor directive that is used to include files in our program. Here we are including the iostream standard file which is necessary for the declarations of basic standard input/output library in  C++.</li>
         <li> Using namespace std: All elements of the standard C++ library are declared within a namespace.  Here we are using the std namespace.</li>
         <li> int main(): The execution of any C++ program starts with the main function, hence it is necessary to have a main function in your program. ‘int’ is the return value of this function. (We will be studying functions in more detail later).</li>
         <li> {}: The curly brackets are used to indicate the starting and ending point of any function. Every opening bracket should have a corresponding closing bracket.</li>
          <li>cout<<”Hello World!\n”; This is a C++ statement. cout represents the standard output stream in  C++. It is declared in the iostream standard file within the std namespace. The text between quotations will be printed on the screen. \n will not be printed, it is used to add a line break. Each statement in C++ ends with a semicolon (;).</li>
          <li>return 0; return signifies the end of a function. Here the function is main, so when we hit return 0, it exits the program. We are returning 0 because we mentioned the return type of the main function as integer (int main). A zero indicates that everything went fine and one indicates that something has gone wrong.</li>
          </ul>
